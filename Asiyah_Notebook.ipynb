    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "When viewing the bar graph, it becomes clear that Squirrel Hill South has the highest playground_count, at 8 playgrounds. After combining all of our metrics, my group also concluded that Squirrel Hill South was the best neighborhood overall in Pittsburgh. Thus, the results of my analysis don't come as much of a shock. I anticipated that due to Squirrel Hill South's popularity, it would have a lot more facilities that cater to children, such as playgrounds. Squirrel Hill South is actually my personal favorite neighborhood in Pittsburgh. During the semester, my friends and I would frequently bus there to go to our favorite Thai restaurant or boba place. That makes the conclusion of the \"best neighborhood\" even more personal and conceivable to me since I have made so many fond memories there. Overall Squirrel Hill South is not only a fun neighborhood according to my opinion, but a neighborhood whose superiority can be supported by statistics as well."
